Consider a row of n coins of values v(1) ... v(n), where n is even. 
We play a game against an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row,
removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money 
we can definitely win if we move first. Solve it using dynamic programing
